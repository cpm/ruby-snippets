These are snippets and libraries from work projects that I was given permission
to release as OSS.

They aren't packaged as proper gems yet, but you can feel free to use them for 
inspiration for your own implementations in your projects.

I may later on package some of these as proper gems, especially if there seems
to be interest. Feel free to create an Issue if you'd like that.
