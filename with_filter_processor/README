In JSONAPI, the normal way to filter an index endpoint is to pass a parameter like:

example.com/resources/?filter[foo]=a,b&filter[bar]=c,d

With the meaning that you are filtering on attribute `foo` by `a` and `b` and
attribute `bar` by `c` and `d`. The spec I don't believe is fussy about if those
are AND or OR conditions.

This is extracted from an application that had around 500+ JSONAPI controllers,
and almost all of them implemented an index action.

I found it nice if we had a `with_filter(:foo, &block)` method available to
actions to DRY up this processing. 

`WithFilterProcessor` does the parsing and handling of the arguments.

`Filterable` is a concern I used to expose `with_filter` in controllers.

`FilterProcessable` is a concern I used to expose `with_filter` in query objects
which are tightly coupled to the controller.
